This is my DS210 Final Project! My objective for this project was to classify a network of online friends by how popular each person is, and find the celebrities within a set of people. To do this, I wanted to create a popularity scale, where the more popular people had a higher score. For my dataset, I used a twitch dataset from SNAP Stanford, named Twitch Social Networks.

Within the project folder, there is the src folder, which includes all of my Rust files. The project folder also includes the dataset I used, and my writeup for the project if you are interested in the output and analysis.
